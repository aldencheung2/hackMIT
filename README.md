This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run 

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"
```

where KEY_PATH is the path to your Google Application Credentials JSON file. For more help with
obtaining the JSON file, go [here](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication).

Next, install and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result!
